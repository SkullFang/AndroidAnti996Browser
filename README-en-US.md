## Project Description
This is a browser project for the [996.ICU](https://github.com/996icu/996.ICU) project on Android platform\.  
This project was created because some of the Chinese browsers banned the users from visiting the
  repository ```996.ICU``` on Github or the site ```996.icu``` because the companies of these
  browsers are ```996```\. I hoped to make Chinese users able to visit the repository and the site
  again, so I started this project\.  
I also hope that more people can join this project to help me\. Let us oppose the ```996``` working
  schedule together!
